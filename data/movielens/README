HOW TO USE MOVIELENS DATA in BPMF

The grouplens website make available a database of movie ratings that can be use
as an input dataset for BPMF. Here is how to use this dataset.

Download and unzip one of their datasets from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.
For example:

    wget http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip
    unzip ml-100k.zip

Convert the files from movielens format to matrix market format. This can be
done in Matlab/Octave using the mm* functions in the data/ subdirectory.

    M = dlmread("ml-100k/u.data", "\t");
    M = M(1:end, 1:3); % only first three collumns
    S = spconvert(M)
    mmwrite("u.mtx", S)


Now you can use u.mtx as input for BPMF:

    ./bpmf u_sample.mtx u_train.mtx
