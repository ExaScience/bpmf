HOW TO USE CHEMBL DATA in BPMF

BPMF can be used to predict compound-on-target activity in chemogenomics. In
this example we will use the ChEMBL publicly available data for this.

1. Download and unzip one of their datasets from ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/ChEMBLdb/
For example ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/ChEMBLdb/latest/chembl_20_mysql.tar.gz

2. Insert the downloaded dump in a SQL database as instructed in the documentation
of the download.

3. Select compound and target activity data. For example, from MySQL:

SELECT DISTINCT
        r.molregno AS compound, 
        a.tid AS target,
        act.standard_value AS value
FROM
        compound_records r,
        activities act,
        assays a

WHERE r.record_id = act.record_id
AND   act.assay_id = a.assay_id
AND   act.standard_units = 'nM'
AND   act.standard_type  = 'IC50' 
into outfile "/tmp/activity.csv";

4. Convert the output from this command to a sparse matrix in matrix market
format. This can be done in Matlab/Octave using the mm* functions in the data/
subdirectory.

    M = dlmread("/tmp/activity.csv", "\t");
    T = M(1:end,2);          % target ids
    [TX,TI,TJ] = unique(T);  % renumber target ids
    C = M(1:end,1);          % compound ids
    [CX,CI,CJ] = unique(C);  % renumber compound ids
    V = real(log10(M(1:end,3))); % log10 of values
    O = [ CJ, TJ, V ];
    S = spconvert(O);
    mmwrite("chembl-IC50.mtx", S);

5. Split the files in to training an test sets

    P = randperm(size(O,1));
    s = round(size(O,1) / 5);
    S_test = spconvert(O(1:s, :));
    mmwrite("chembl-test-IC50.mtx", S_test);
    S_train = spconvert(O(s+1:end, :));
    mmwrite("chembl-train-IC50.mtx", S_train);

Now you can use the .mtx files as input for BPMF:

    ./bpmf chembl-train-IC50.mtx chembl-test-IC50.mtx
